\section*{Problem 5}
It is not possible to have a DFA that will accept strings with more 1's than 0's. An attempt
would be to have 3 main states, a nuetral state, a state that means more 0's than 1's, and 
a state that means more 1's than 0's. However, this does not work because this three state system
does not take into account of a difference of 1's and 0's of more than 1. This means that we would
theoretically need an infinite amount of states in order to act as a weight.
